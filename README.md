# Introduction

The `ocp4-upi-kvm` [project](https://github.com/ocp-power-automation/ocp4-upi-kvm) provides Terraform based automation code to help the deployment of OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) 4.x on KVM VMs using libvirt.

This project leverages the [following ansible playbook](https://github.com/RedHatOfficial/ocp4-helpernode) to setup a
helper node (bastion) for OCP deployment.
